WHAT?

This repository provides an APL script to define functions
which convert dates from the Gregorian calendar to the French
Revolutionary calendar or the other way. E.g.:

     ⍝ converting 18 Brumaire VIII
     fr2gr 8 2 18
  1799 11 9
     ⍝ converting back 9 November 1799
     gr2fr 1799 11 9
  8 2 18
     ⍝ pretty-print the date
     prtfr 8 2 18
  18 Brumaire 8, jour de la dentelaire

WHY?

Because programming the French Revolutionary calendar has long
been a favorite programming exercise to me.
