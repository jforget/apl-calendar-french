<h1>French Revolutionary Calendar</h1>
<h2><a name='What' id='What'>What?</a></h2>

<p>
This repository provides an APL script to define functions
which convert dates from the Gregorian calendar to the French
Revolutionary calendar or the other way. E.g.:
</p>

<pre>
     ⍝ converting 18 Brumaire VIII
     fr2gr 8 2 18
  1799 11 9
     ⍝ converting back 9 November 1799
     gr2fr 1799 11 9
  8 2 18
     ⍝ pretty-print the date
     prtfr 8 2 18
  18 Brumaire 8, jour de la dentelaire
     ⍝ Printing today
     prtfr gr2rd ⎕TS[1 2 3]
</pre>

<h2><a name='Why' id='Why'>Why?</a></h2>

<p>
Because programming the French Revolutionary calendar has long
been a favorite programming exercise to me.

I learned APL more than thirty years ago. At this time, the only programming
languages I knew where two programmable calculators (HP-25 plus another brand
I have forgotten) and LSE, a French-speaking light version of Algol.
And, a theoretical knowledge of BASIC, without any practice.
For about one year, I had access to an APL interpreter and I
wrote a French Revolutionary calendar program. The only remaining archive
from this time is a paper sheet with a calendar of this year.
</p>
<p>
Then for more than thirty years, I drifted away from APL.
During this time, I learned
Fortran, HP-41, Pascal, Lisp, C, COBOL, Hypertalk, SQL, PL-SQL,
awk, Caml, lex, yacc, C++, Apple Script, HTML, Intercal,
T<sub>E</sub>X, L<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X, METAPOST,
Perl, XML, Ruby, METAFONT, HP-48, Smalltalk, R, Lua,
a few shell interpreters and assembly languages and some specific languages
not worthy of your interest.
When I write that I learned these languages, the situation
varies a lot and for many languages mentioned above, I cannot
fluently write a programme. For example, I learned C++ by reading Bjarne Stroustrup's
book and writing an "Hello World" programme and I did nothing
more. And for R, I juste read a book, I did not  even write a
line of code.
</p>
<p>
At the same time, during these thirty-or-so years, I discovered Unix and GNU/Linux,
Emacs, Vi, Emacs-Viper, important concepts such as interoperability between
differing systems and differing architecture, and so on.
So, the 1980-vintage APL, with its dedicated charset and its sandbox-like
architecture (workspaces) had lost its appeal when compared with the time
when I discovered it. On the other hand, GNU APL 1.4, using Unicode, allowing
the use of pipeline-compatible scripts in addition to workspaces,
allowing to create and update these scripts with any source editor
including the best-known ones, was a wonderful thing in my mind.

<h2><a name='When' id='When'>When?</a></h2>

<p>
From April 2015 to May 2015. The writing of the programme took longer than
it should have been, because when you have 
an APL programme on one screen and
<cite>OSS 117: Lost in Rio</cite> or
<cite>Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid</cite>
on the other, keeping concentrated on the programme is
rather difficult.

<p>
In this chapter, Your Mileage May Vary.
My computer runs xubuntu 12.04 and I edit texts
with GNU Emacs 23.3.1 in viper-mode.
You should not have trouble with any other version of Unix.
You will have to make minor changes if you use Emacs
without viper mode. But if you run Windows or if you
use another source editor, the explanations below
will be next to useless.

<h3>Running simple scripts</h3>

<p>
I tried to run APL scripts from a xterm window. I did not
like it because of the color theme, because the results are
printed in black on a black background. And when you leave APL and come
back to the shell, you keep this very unfortunate color combination.
Yes, I should use the <tt>--noColor</tt> parameter, but I have 
a tendency to forget it. And when I type it, I forget where
the upper-case letter is located.
</p>
<p>
Another more compelling reason is how to type the special characters.
Some solutions are explained in
<tt>/path/to/compilation/directory/apl-1.4/README-3-keyboard</tt>,
but I find them rather awkward. Instead of that, I run the following
Lisp code:
</p>
<pre>
(progn
(defun apl-insert ()
       "Inserting an APL char"
       (interactive)
                     ; arithmetic     vector          program
                     ; mathematic
  (let* ((apl-conv '(("times"  . "×") ("rho"    . "⍴") ("gets"    . "←")
                     ("div"    . "÷") ("iota"   . "⍳") ("goto"    . "→")
                     ("neg"    . "¯") ("drop"   . "↓") ("del"     . "∇")
                     ("circ"   . "○") ("take"   . "↑") ("lamp"    . "⍝")
                     ))
          (ch1 (cdr (assoc (completing-read "Car ? "
                                            (mapcar 'car apl-conv)
                                            nil t)
                            apl-conv))))
     (insert ch1))
)
(global-set-key '[f6] 'apl-insert)
)
</pre>
<p>
And then I use the <tt>M-x shell</tt> function of Emacs.
In the shell buffer, I can run the APL interpreter, which
writes with black characters on a white background.
And when I need to, I press the F6 key, then I type the
mnemonic of a character, which is inserted in the APL line
being typed.
</p>
<p>
If the required char is missing from the Lisp code above, I go
and fetch it from 
<tt>/path/to/compilation/directory/apl-1.4/README-3-keyboard</tt>
or from
<tt>/path/to/compilation/directory/apl-1.4/support-files/old-Keyboard/keyboard.txt</tt>,
I add a new mnemonic+char pair in <tt>apl-insert</tt> and
I rerun the <tt>defun</tt>.
