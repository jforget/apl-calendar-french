<h1>French Revolutionary Calendar</h1>

<p>
This repository provides an APL script to define functions
which convert dates from the Gregorian calendar to the French
Revolutionary calendar or the other way. E.g.:
</p>

<pre>
     ⍝ converting 18 Brumaire VIII
     fr2gr 8 2 18
  1799 11 9
     ⍝ converting back 9 November 1799
     gr2fr 1799 11 9
  8 2 18
     ⍝ pretty-print the date
     prtfr 8 2 18
  18 Brumaire 8, jour de la dentelaire
     ⍝ Printing today
     prtfr gr2rd ⎕TS[1 2 3]
</pre>

<p>
Because programming the French Revolutionary calendar has long
been a favorite programming exercise to me.

I learned APL more than thirty years ago. At this time, the only programming
languages I knew where two programmable calculators (HP-25 plus another brand
I have forgotten) and LSE, a French-speaking light version of Algol.
And, a theoretical knowledge of BASIC, without any practice.
For about one year, I had access to an APL interpreter and I
wrote a French Revolutionary calendar program. The only remaining archive
from this time is a paper sheet with a calendar of this year.
</p>
<p>
Then for more than thirty years, I drifted away from APL.
During this time, I learned
Fortran, HP-41, Pascal, Lisp, C, COBOL, Hypertalk, SQL, PL-SQL,
awk, Caml, lex, yacc, C++, Apple Script, HTML, Intercal,
T<sub>E</sub>X, L<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X, METAPOST,
Perl, XML, Ruby, METAFONT, HP-48, Smalltalk, R, Lua,
a few shell interpreters and some specific languages
not worthy of your interest.
When I write that I learned these languages, the situation
varies a lot. For example, I learned C++ by reading Bjarne Stroustrup's
book and writing an "Hello World" programme and I did nothing
more. And for R, I juste read a book, I did not  even write a
line of code.
